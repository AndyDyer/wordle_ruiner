in my current approach we can run out of guesses on words like ABBED or ABEAR

I am not sure what the best approach is to solve situations like that  see validation.csv for the outcomes of all words wordle can ask


I tried a hueristic where youd guess high point words regardless of what results came back from wordle for the first 3 but it failed to move the needle.

|average guesses | 3.57960247	|
|ran out of guesses | 2609	| 
|success percent |	80% |
